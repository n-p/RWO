User Guide:
1- You need python installed on your machine (for Windows and OS X).
2- Use this command to install python-chess module:
pip install python-chess
3- Change this line in uci.py located in site-packages->chess folder (maybe there is a function in python-chess and i don't know):
after this function:
def setoption(self, options, async_callback=None):
change
"
builder.append("value")
to:
"
if not (name == 'Clear' and value == 'Hash'):
    builder.append("value")
    
4- A file with many FEN positions. You can modify book.epd from Joona Kiiski's SPSA repository (needs modifications).
5- Follow the 'Tuning with SPSA' section in https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Creating-my-first-test to change stockfish code.
You should change or modify uci.cpp, types.h, main.cpp, and add tune.h before compiling.
6- Important: Choose number of samples in main function. Choose big enough sample size so that mean error should not change much.
7- The program will write logs in 'result.txt' file. You could use them later.
8- File names should be base for current master compile and stockfish for modified version (or change it in python code).
9- Choose depth for modified engine and base engine in find_error() function. In the future it should be able to get values from a dataset file instead of base engine's evaluations. For example numbers provided by grandmasters for (FEN) positions or from the PGN of LTC tournament. It's goal is to change tuning values to minimize the difference between current evaluations and ideal evaluations.
10- Run the program.
