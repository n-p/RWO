### What's new
* Automatic detection of tuning variables.
* Now it shows which values changed during last iteration.
* It's testing just small random samples before testing them thoroughly.

### How it works?
* This tuner is using the simple random walking for position-based tuning of stockfish chess engine (using centipawn values generated by it). It can be applied to other engines as well with some modifications.
